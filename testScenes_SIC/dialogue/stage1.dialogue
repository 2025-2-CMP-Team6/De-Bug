???: Ugh... my head. Wait, where am I? The whole world is made of... pixels? Aaaah! Even my hands are pixels!
???: Oh my god, did I fall into a game world? This feeling... it's exactly like that arcade game I used to play as a kid.

~ after_portal
???: That portal... it might be the only way out of here.
???: I guess there's no turning back now. Let's see where this leads!

~ tutorial_dash
???: To reach the next platform, I'll need to dash while jumping!
???: Let me try pressing SHIFT while in the air.

???: Monsters born from corrupted code.
???: See? Taking damage from a Glitch reduces your health by one block.
???: I should use a skill. Let's try left-clicking at the enemy.

~ tutorial_middleBoss
???: Look! There's a heavily corrupted Mid-Boss Glitch in front of the portal!
???: It's stronger than the normal ones, but defeating it might grant you a new skill or upgrade an existing one.
???: Want to take it on?
